In recent years, some articles have feature my research and outreach efforts. 


Back in 2017, in collaboration with the I-STEM initiative, I designed a one-day course to showcase to 30 Illinois high-school students the power of mathematics in modeling disease spread. This was so fun! Using the game VAX , students were given a limited number of vaccines and applied them to a network (breaking a link from one person to another) to try to stop a disease from spreading. Check out a summary here: <a href = "http://istem.illinois.edu/news/istemcamp.17.html" > I-STEM Multidisciplinary Summer Program Exposes UHS Athletes to Different STEM Departments/Units </a>.

"In a website game, called VAX, students were given a limited number of “quarantines” (breaking a link from one person to another) to try to stop a disease from spreading. Once the disease got started, however, it spread rapidly from person to person. The students were quite engaged as they scrambled to try stop the spread of the disease—with varying degrees of success." -  Elizabeth Innes
