<p> I am Vanessa, a newly minted Mathematics Ph.D. from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My main interests mathematical modeling and machine learning to provide insight to real-world problems. At the next stage of my career, I am looking to use my experience in interdisciplinary and computational projects in R, Python, and MATLAB for social good. I also enjoy taking pictures, drawing, and bowling.</p>
